*Description:-*

A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. It is a standalone web page specifically designed for marketing or advertising purposes. It is created with the intention of driving user engagement and encouraging visitors to take a specific action, such as making a purchase, subscribing to a newsletter, or filling out a form.
Landing pages are often used in digital marketing campaigns to target specific audiences and promote a particular product, service, or offer. They are designed to be focused and concise, with minimal distractions, so that visitors can quickly understand the value proposition and take the desired action.
